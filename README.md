# Simple Chatting 

This is a chat web application built with Node.js and socket.io, used to help me practice with web sockets. 

A cool goal with web sockets that I could explore in the future is recreating Tetris battles, since the original version has shut down and my friends and I have yet to find a good replacement for it. 

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone this repository 
1. Use `npm install` to install the dependencies
